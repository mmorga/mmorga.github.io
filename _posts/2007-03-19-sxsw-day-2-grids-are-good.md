This panel was on using the modern design technique of grid layout to improve web site design.  This one was good, but would have benefitted from a longer session - 30 minutes was rushed.  My notes:

* subtraction.com
* markboulton.co.uk
* 2 dots imply a design
* columns turn to grid
* rationalism < decore + logic, reason
* standardization
* crate & barrel's web site is a good example
* commentisfree.guardian.co.uk
* yeeaahh.subtraction.com
* 3 or 4 columns in multiples of the base column width - 12 total is ideal
