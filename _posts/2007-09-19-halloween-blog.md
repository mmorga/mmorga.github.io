My buddy [Anton](http://antonolsen.com/) has started a [Halloween blog](http://halloween.lr2.com/).  I'll be contributing a few articles beginning this weekend with an article on making a few different kinds of blood.  In the mean time, make sure to link to his blog for a [chance to win $50](http://halloween.lr2.com/2007/09/19/win-50-bucks/).
