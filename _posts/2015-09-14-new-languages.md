First some benchmarks (warning: one benchmark/language name is NSFW): https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks

Further warning, benchmarks can be [as truthful as any other statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies%2C_damned_lies%2C_and_statistics).

1st is [Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org/):

* Ruby-like syntax
* static type checking (but types donâ€™t need to be declared)
* compiled performance beats Go in most benchmarks above!

2nd is [Red](http://www.red-lang.org/):

* Inspired by [Rebol](http://rebol.com/) (which dates back to [AmigaOS](http://www.amigaos.net/))
* functional, imperative, and symbolic programming
* prototypical inheritance
* optional types with [50+ built-in data types](http://www.red-lang.org/2015/06/054-new-datatypes-exceptions-and-set.html)
* < 1MB install
* Consists of high level Red language 95% compatible with Rebol version 2 and [Red/System DSL](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html) for higher performance systems programming
