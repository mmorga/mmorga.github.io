Snarkerati posted a pretty cool list of [50 best films depicting a dystopia](http://snarkerati.com/movie-news/the-top-50-dystopian-movies-of-all-time/).  I'd argue with some of the ranking (good grief - they included the two worst sci-fi films of all time: Starship Troopers and Total Recall), but it definitely has some good stuff on the list.
