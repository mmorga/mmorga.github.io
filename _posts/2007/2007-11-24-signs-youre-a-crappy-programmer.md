[Anton](http://antonolsen.com/) sent me a link to Damien Katz's "funny because it's true" article about the symptoms of [being a crappy programmer](http://damienkatz.net/2006/05/signs_youre_a_c.html?repeat).  I wish everyone at work would read and think about this.

The fact of the matter is that everyone is guilty of something on this list from time to time.  It reminds me that I really need to refactor the copy/paste coding that I did on Thursday night when adding a new feature to [Cruise Control Rb](http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/).
