Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu director of "Babel", Alfonso Cuaron, director of "Children of Men", and one of my favorite directors, Guillermo del Toro, of "Pan's Labyrinth", [sit down with Charlie Rose and discuss their work](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8155571489738252066&sourceid=docidfeed&hl=en).

I haven't seen "Babel" yet (though it looks interesting), but I'm dying to see "Children of Men" and especially "Pan's Labyrinth".  Which I plan on driving to Austin to see on [January 12th](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/originalalamo/~3/69975436/pans-labyrinth-to-open-alamo-south.html).

Any other takers?

P.S.  If anyone reading this (is anyone reading this?) hasn't seen [The Devil's Backbone](http://www.amazon.com/Devils-Backbone-Special-Marisa-Paredes/dp/B000274TLW/sr=8-1/qid=1167893916/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-0796848-1571039?ie=UTF8&s=dvd) run out and buy a copy on DVD ASAP.  I guarantee you will love it.  It's one of the best ghost stories that I've ever seen.
