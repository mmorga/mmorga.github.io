Thanks to [Heather](http://heather.halo5.net/?p=110), I came across this career matching quiz.  Boy have I ever been in the wrong line of work.

My results with commentary in parenthesis:
*1.  Makeup Artist  (heh - for horror films maybe)*
*2.  Costume Designer  (also heh - ditto)*
3.  Set Designer (hmm)
4.  Baker  (Sure)
5.  Butcher  (Nah)
6.  Cook  (I love to cook, but don't want to make it a job)
7.  Hydrologist / Hydrogeologist (No interest)
8.  Special Effects Technician (Sure!)
9.  Carpenter (Possibly)
10.  Industrial Designer (Put more blinking lights on it!)

Select other entries:
*12.  Dietitian (for the See Food Diet)*
*19.  Fashion Designer (Have you seen how I dress?)*
*25.  Interior Designer (With a specialty in Steampunk interiors)*
*27.  Pet Groomer (Specialty in shaved cats)*
*38.  Food Scientist (Just like Clark Griswold)*

Try it for yourself.
