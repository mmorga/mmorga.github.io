Cinematical has published its list of the [ten best short films of 2006](http://www.cinematical.com/2006/12/27/eat-my-shorts-the-best-of-2006/).  There are some great shorts in the list.  Here are my favorites:

[Between You and Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-5cJse8_Zk&search=%22Between%20You%20and%20Me%22)

Shot using the burst mode on a digital SLR, this one has a really cool look almost like stop motion animation.  A man searches for a woman he met when trying to rescue her from an attacker using only the photos on digital camera she left behind.

[Still Life](http://www.atomfilms.com/film/still_life.jsp)

A very cool and creepy Twilight Zone style short.  A young man's bizarre experience when stopping in a small town.

[Alive in Joburg](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1185812222812358837)

Amazing special effects and put together documentary style story of aliens assimilating in South Africa.

[They Came to Attack Us](http://www.atomfilms.com/film/came_to_attack_us.jsp)

A fun special effects sci-fi comedy about an alien attack and those chosen (from the future?) to save humanity.
