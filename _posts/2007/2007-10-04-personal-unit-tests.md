Hober has a [Backpack](http://www.backpackit.com/) page with his [personal unit tests](http://hober.backpackit.com/pub/1233865) an idea he heard from [Without an E](http://withoutane.com/rants/2007/08/personal-unit-tests).

I think they each came up with too many goals to hit daily, but who am I to judge.
