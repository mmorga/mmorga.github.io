The first session we attended was the Snakes on a Plane discussion.  It was moderately interesting, but a little light on insightful commentary.  Ultimately, I agreed with one panel member - the biggest problem with SoaP was that it was released too late after the hype peaked - people lost interest in what was otherwise a perfectly entertaining little genre disaster movie.

Notes:

* User generated content was added to the film (dialog, situations, etc.)
* sods50.org (suspension of disbelief) - had an event based around viewing the film ala Rocky Horror
* Crowds smell marketing a mile away
* Timing was an issue in underperformance
* How to get people involved?
* Permitting Mash-ups: no lawyers cease and desist letters, no one sued
* Additional 5 days of filming for fan additions and replacement of real snakes with CGI snakes
* Similar to Blair Witch Project in building an Internet audience
* Potential for Internet success with minimal budget - Ok, Go video for example
* Movies can embrace the Mash-up and remix culture
