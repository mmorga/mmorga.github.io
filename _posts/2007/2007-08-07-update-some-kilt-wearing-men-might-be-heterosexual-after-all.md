There's a little bit of a trail to follow here, but I came across the web site [Baptists for Brownback](http://baptistsforbrown2008.wordpress.com/2007/07/30/update-some-kilt-wearing-men-might-be-heterosexual-after-all/) via a post on [Bible Versus](http://biblewithhugh.blogspot.com/2007/08/demoniacs.html) linked to by the [Real Live Preacher](http://www.reallivepreacher.com/node/1392).  Oh the paths that the Internet leads you on.

This site reads like something you might find on [the Onion](http://www.theonion.com), but it appears to be the honest opinions of the writers [Update - many friends think this is a humor site - please let it be so!].  Regardless, it is some of the funniest stuff I've read online in a long time.  The best article is the one which gave me the title of this post.

> [Update: Some kilt-wearing men might be heterosexual after all](http://baptistsforbrown2008.wordpress.com/2007/07/30/update-some-kilt-wearing-men-might-be-heterosexual-after-all/)

Some of the comments on the post (and on the initial post) have really funny quotes as well such as:

> [When you put on a kilt you are stepping out of God's laws. You might just as well wear wizard robes and read Henry (sic) Potter.](http://baptistsforbrown2008.wordpress.com/2007/07/28/the-sissification-of-seattle/#comment-3188)

My only fear is that they'll read this post and decide that I belong on their list of ["People Who are Probably Going To Hell"](http://baptistsforbrown2008.wordpress.com/sow/).  I'll just have to risk it.

Another Update:

Most importantly, I forgot to add a link here to [my favorite kilt wearing buddy](http://sweaterproject.org/).
