I've been so busy for the last year, that I haven't made a new film of my own.  I have a couple of shorts lately, one of which I may post up here if I get a chance to finish a couple of polish issues.  The other short, a variation of the [Get Smart](http://imdb.com/title/tt0058805/) television intro, I put together for work.  It turned out pretty decent - if you are a Rackspace employee, you will likely see it soon.
