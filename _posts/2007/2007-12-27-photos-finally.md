I finally was able to process a number of sets of photos tonight.

I ordered and received a [Strobist](http://strobist.blogspot.com/) [kit from MPEX](http://www.mpex.com/page.htm?PG=Strobist%20Kits).  Here is an example or two from my first experiments with the kids:

I also took a few snapshots at Christmas.  First one from an early Christmas with the kids at my parent's house:

Then over at my grandmother's house for Christmas Eve:

Christmas day, I was up at my parent's house near the Guadalupe River, so we decided to goof around with the cameras outside:

The following day, [David](http://sweaterproject.org/), [Edward](http://edspace.com/blog/) and I went downtown to get a few shots of the Christmas lights on the Riverwalk.
