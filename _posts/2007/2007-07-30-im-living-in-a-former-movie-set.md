My buddy [Travis](http://www.darkdesignpictures.com/blog) used my apartment this weekend to shoot a short for the [San Antonio Local Film Festival (SAL)](http://salfilmfest.com/).  

Another home in which my neighbors wonder why zombies are roaming the neighborhood or why guys are carrying a girl wrapped in a tarp down the stairs.  Oh well.
