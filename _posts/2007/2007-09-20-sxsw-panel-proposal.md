When [Anton Olsen](http://www.antonolsen.com) and I were at SXSW Interactive this past spring, we decided to propose a class on web application testing.  Part of the panel selection criteria is determined by community voting.  Voting is open now, but closes soon (Midnight on Friday).

If you have a little time, please consider voting for our panel. (Registration is required to vote).

Our proposal is here:

The general Panel Picker page is here:
[http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/)

Once the votes are counted the SXSW panel will take 3-4 weeks to decide which panels will get the green light.

Thanks!
