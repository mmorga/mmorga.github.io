I have argued about whether or not I enjoy "Chick Flicks".  Some claim that I simply don't like them.  I argue that I do, but I hold them to the same criteria for quality that I hold any other movie - they don't get a buy simply because of their genre.

Last night, I watched[All About My Mother](http://imdb.com/title/tt0185125/) which I define as a chick flick (and I loved it).  But perhaps I simply have some misconceptions about what defines a chick flick.

Throwing out a definition, I came up with "a movie describing human relationships (often romantic) from a woman's perspective."  With this definition in mind, I came up with the following movies immediately:

* [Amelie](http://imdb.com/title/tt0211915/)
* [All About My Mother](http://imdb.com/title/tt0185125/)
* [Volver](http://imdb.com/title/tt0441909/)
* [Like Water for Chocolate](http://imdb.com/title/tt0103994/)

A friend disagreed with the entire list - saying that having to read the movie (subtitled) ruins the effect.

Over lunch today,[Greg Lange](http://www.greglange.com), [Edward Mao](http://edspace.com/blog/) and I were talking about this.  I described the plots of the above movies and they disagreed with my designation of the movies in question as chick flicks also.  Stymied, I asked for a definition from Greg.  He came up with:

> Chick Flicks have a simple plot, and are about a woman and one or two guys.

I've seen some movies like this, but I'm not sure most people would describe them as chick flicks.

Just to avoid being called a foreign film snob, I came up with some American or at least English language chick flick movies:

* [When Harry Met Sally](http://imdb.com/title/tt0098635/)
* [Sleepless in Seattle](http://imdb.com/title/tt0108160/)
* [Bridget Jones's Diary](http://imdb.com/title/tt0243155/)
* [My Big Fat Greek Wedding](http://imdb.com/title/tt0259446/)
* [Whale Rider](http://imdb.com/title/tt0298228/)
* [Four Weddings and a Funeral](http://imdb.com/title/tt0109831/)
* [The African Queen](http://imdb.com/title/tt0043265/)
* [Bringing Up Baby](http://imdb.com/title/tt0029947/)
* Franco Zeffirelli's[Romeo and Juliet](http://imdb.com/title/tt0063518/)
* [Casablanca](http://imdb.com/title/tt0034583/)
* [Lost in Translation](http://imdb.com/title/tt0335266/) (from Ed)


I later [found](http://www.filmsite.org/greatchickflicks.html) a [few](http://www.mutantreviewers.com/cchick.html) [links](http://www.chickflickguide.com/) about the topic which triggered positive memories about the following:

* [The Truth About Cats and Dogs](http://imdb.com/title/tt0117979/)
* [Bend It Like Beckham](http://imdb.com/title/tt0286499/)
* [Shall We Dansu?](http://imdb.com/title/tt0117615/) (I'm picking the original Japanese version here)
* [Romeo + Juliet](http://imdb.com/title/tt0117509/)
* [Legally Blonde](http://imdb.com/title/tt0250494/)
* [It Could Happen To You](http://imdb.com/title/tt0110167/)

Also, these lists had some seriously weird choices for "chick flicks".  For example:

* [Bound](http://imdb.com/title/tt0115736/)
* [Jawbreaker](http://imdb.com/title/tt0155776/)
* [Heathers](http://imdb.com/title/tt0097493/)
* [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead](http://imdb.com/title/tt0100519/)
* [Aliens](http://imdb.com/title/tt0090605/)
* [Girlfight](http://imdb.com/title/tt0210075/)
* [Bull Durham](http://imdb.com/title/tt0094812/)

Hmm.

Greg came up with the following:

* [Something to Talk About](http://imdb.com/title/tt0114496/) (Mark: Missed it - adding to Netflix)
* [Romeo + Juliet](http://imdb.com/title/tt0117509/) (Mark: yup - I liked it too)
* [Chocolat](http://imdb.com/title/tt0241303/) (Mark: which I couldn't finish watching)
* [You've Got Mail](http://imdb.com/title/tt0128853/) (Mark: wasn't this an AOL commercial?  Aww)

Edmo came up with:

* [Love Actually](http://imdb.com/title/tt0314331/) (Mark: Adding to Netflix)
* [Garden State](http://imdb.com/title/tt0333766/) (Edmo adds: "maybe, but it's very borderline chick flick")
* [Lost In Translation](http://imdb.com/title/tt0335266/) (Mark: Loved it)

And the number one - suggested by a friend is[The Notebook](http://imdb.com/title/tt0332280/) - which I've got in my queue already!

So what do y'all think?  I declare myself not a chick flick hater!
