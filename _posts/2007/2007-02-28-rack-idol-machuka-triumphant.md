My group's entry into the Rackspace Rack Idol competition somehow came out on top with our rousing Bluegrass rendition of "Don't Cha" by the Pussycat Dolls.

Thanks to my bandmates [Chuck](http://thethiers.com/) and [Kaan](http://blog.erdener.org/)!  Without you none of this will happen.  Your checks are in the mail.

Kudos also to everyone else who participated - y'all are why Rackspace is so much fun to work for!

More pictures of the event can be found on [Anton](http://flickr.com/photos/antonolsen/sets/72157594561013908/) and [Scott's](http://flickr.com/photos/scottsimpson/sets/72157594561950851/) Flickr pages.

UPDATE: [Chuck uploaded his pix to Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/thethiers/sets/72157594563174436/).
