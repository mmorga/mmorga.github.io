For a number of work and personal life reasons, I haven't worked on a new short film of my own for over a year.  I've been playing with a few ideas in my head and I have a couple of partial scripts in various states of incompletion.  I have the advantage of no deadlines and no one waiting on me, so I can play pretty freely with ideas for as long as I want to.  Without giving away too much, the main ideas are:

* YAHM - Yet Another Horror Movie.  Vampire flavor. This one is my most complete script and I think it's the best I've written.
* A story of a man attempting to redeem an act of violence when only the perpetrator holds himself responsible.
* A commercial for a fine product that doesn't yet exist.
* A compendium of some of the more stupendously bad dates me or my friends have been on.
* A pure action piece
* YAHM - Part Two.  The Guadalupe River Monster

Gentle readers, what do you think?  What would you like me to work on first?

Once I have the first idea locked down, script written and a moderate amount of pre-production done, I will reward myself with a [Letus35Mini](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=177&modelid=16206">Canon HV30</a>, <a href="http://www.letus35.com/), and a few Canon FD lenses.
