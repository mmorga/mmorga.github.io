My favorite development language/framework for the last nine months or so has been [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).  At lunch today with my Dad and one of his buddies, the topic came up and I started thinking about how to get people up and running with Ruby on Rails.  Here are my thoughts:

### Getting it Installed

For OS X and various Linux flavors, I recommend getting Ruby on Rails from the main [Ruby on Rails site](http://www.rubyonrails.org/down).

Rails development on Windows is a little more of a challenge, but you can get a reasonable start (at least enough to try things out) with [InstantRails](http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/).

### Editors

You can edit Ruby code with any text editor.  I prefer [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) on Mac OS X, but [Komodo](http://www.activestate.com/Products/komodo_ide/index.mhtml) and [JEdit](http://www.jedit.org/) are reasonable and work on Windows and Linux.

### Online Tutorials

This is a little tough at the moment, because Rails 2.1 hasn't had as many "getting started" tutorials written as the 1.2x versions of Rails had.

There is a long tutorial at [Tutorials Point](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails-2.1/index.htm) which looks like a good start.

The main Rails site has a page of [tutorials and documentation links](http://www.rubyonrails.org/docs).

### Screencasts

Screencasts are a fantastic way to learn Rails.  There is a huge wealth of information here.

[Railscasts](http://railscasts.com) are a series of over 100 screencasts about Rails.

[Peepcode](http://peepcode.com/) has a number of great quality screencasts for $9 each.

### Books

The two books that I recommend most are:

[Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProgramming-Ruby-Pragmatic-Programmers-Second%2Fdp%2F0974514055%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1213750192%26sr%3D1-1&tag=comahill-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=comahill-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1) by Dave Thomas, Chad Fowler and Andy Hunt,  and [The Rails Way](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRails-Way-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Ruby%2Fdp%2F0321445619%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1213750036%26sr%3D8-1&tag=comahill-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=comahill-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1) by Obie Fernandez.

These two books are a great learning and reference combination for Ruby on Rails development.

What are you waiting for?  Get learning!
