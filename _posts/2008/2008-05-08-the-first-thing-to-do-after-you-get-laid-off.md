[Interesting article here](http://www.expatsoftware.com/articles/2008/05/laid-off-one-thing-you-absolutely-need.html) about leaving on a *real* vacation right after getting laid off.  Most of my life, I haven't been in the financial position to do this and thankfully I've only been laid off once.

I love the idea - shows how much I need a vacation - but I wonder if I'd have the guts to do it.
