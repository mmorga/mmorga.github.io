I've come across some environments built to help people (and especially kids) to learn programming.

{% picture right article_images/2015-07-09-environments-to-learn-programming/sonic-pi-logo.png %} [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) is perfect for people with an interest in music. It’s a live coding synthesizer that lets you perform music using code (a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)). Check out the demos – it’s pretty cool. One of the authors actually uses it for live gigs in nightclubs.

{% picture left article_images/2015-07-09-environments-to-learn-programming/pharo-logo.png %} [Pharo](http://pharo.org/) is a [Smalltalk](http://www.smalltalk.org/main/) implementation designed for learning. Very cool features and live code browser. When you run it, it starts a tutorial to learn Smalltalk.

Finally [iPython](http://ipython.org/) started off as an improved [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) for [Python](https://www.python.org/). The notebook module added the ability for a web browser to display an interactive environment that supports the display of cells with Markdown rendering, editable code blocks that you can edit and run in the browser and graphics libraries to draw dynamic graphics. Notebooks are JSON files, so you can download lots of pre-made ones including a couple that teach Python programming. There are some [videos](http://ipython.org/videos.html#videos) which show off the features available.

{% picture right article_images/2015-07-09-environments-to-learn-programming/jupyter-sq-text.png %}The [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) project is forking from iPython to provide the same feature set but allowing code engines that support other languages like R, Ruby, Go, etc. [Installing and getting it all working](http://ipython.org/install.html) is more involved than the above options so I can’t recommend it as highly, but it’s worth looking at. I can see it being a useful tool when you are exploring some techniques or munging some data.
