When I was a kid, my Dad was in the Air Force and we lived in Panama.  My Dad had the chance to visit a lot of countries in South America and one of his favorites was Peru.  Peru makes a clear spirit called Pisco (distilled from grapes like a less refined brandy).  The Peruvian national drink is the Pisco Sour.  There is a little bit of controversy since neighboring Chile also claims to have invented the Pisco Sour, but I'll stick with Peru for no other reason than that's the country I first heard associated with the Pisco Sour.  This drink was very popular in Panama as well and it seems like my parents enjoyed this more than once at parties with friends.

Today at lunch, I stopped by the best liquor and wine store in San Antonio, [Joe Saglimbeni Fine Wines](http://www.jsfinewine.com) and noticed that they carried six or so different varieties of Pisco.  I asked for a recommendation and purchased it to surprise my parents with when I see them tomorrow.

Next I needed a recipe for the Pisco Sour (I think it's best not to drink Pisco straight).  I found [this excellent site that links to several good recipes](http://perufood.blogspot.com/2006/02/recipe-pisco-sour.html).
