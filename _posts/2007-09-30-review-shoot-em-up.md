This [movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465602/) is not for everyone.  In a lot of respects, it is beyond offensive.  However, if you view it as a live-action cartoon, it is highly over-the-top and entertaining.  This movie is for the people who enjoy Hong Kong style action and can find humor in the macabre.  I laughed through just about the entire thing.  There isn't a down moment in the movie - it is non-stop action.

Additional warning: about 10 minutes into the movie, [David](http://sweaterproject.org/) leaned over and said "This is the most fouled up movie I've ever seen."*

\* Or something like that.
