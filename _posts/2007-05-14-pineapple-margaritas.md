I've seen a couple of recipes for a pineapple margarita, but they either had ingredients that I didn't like (sour mix) or looked too sweet.  Here's my take on one:

In a blender, add the following:

* 2 c. chopped fresh pineapple *
* juice of 2 limes
* 1 c. white tequila (Sauza Blanco or better)
* 1/2 c. Tripple Sec
* Ice

Blend away and enjoy.

\* I used pineapple soaked overnight in tequila, drain off the tequila (which tasted great over ice) and use the pineapple you don't turn into margaritas for a tasty desert with whipped cream.
