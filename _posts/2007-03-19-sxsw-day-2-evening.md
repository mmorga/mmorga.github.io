Anton and I planned on stopping by the Dorkbot tent, but the line and crowd were too intimidating, so we left, checked into our hotel, then came back for later events.

The [frog design](http://www.frogdesign.com/) SXSW Opening Party was pretty cool.  [Malford Milligan's](http://www.malfordmilligan.com/) band put on a great blues show and the Interactive crowd proved all kinds of stereotypes about computer oriented people true.  We stayed for an hour or so, then headed out a few blocks away to the final party of the night.

The [BuzzFeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/) / [Ze Frank](http://www.zefrank.com/) After Party at the [Molotov Lounge](http://www.molotovlounge.com/) was a good time.   Open bar - we had a lot of great conversations with people who will never remember having them with us.  Also, we ran into [Anton's](http://www.antonolsen.com) long, lost brother:  [this guy](http://michaelraichelson.com/)
