Saturday morning came awfully early after being out so late Friday night, but I managed to meet Anton on time.

The first session of the day was "Why XSLT is sexy".  I was curios about this since I had mostly written off the suitability of XSLT as a means of making good presentation of XML.  It just always seemed like there were easier ways to solve the problem.  My notes were:

Notes:

* First slide: Putting Lipstick on a Pig
* Joe Orr, Lindsay Simon
* XSLT running on XML DOM parser in browser
* Unlike CSS can add new elements to the page
* XSL is a functional language - not procedural
* Fast processor in most browsers (Safari lagging)
* ActiveWidgetGrid
* bandwidth saving advantages - dl the XSL once, process many XML transactions (like AJAX ezchanges)
* AJAX-S
* XML Binding Language
* Freja and Formbuilder: MVC for Javascript, XSL is a View
* Sarissa: presents same syntax for all browsers
* AspectXML
* BrowserBasedXML.com
* detects browser w/ XSL engine and transfers only the appropriate XSL file - easier to keep browser specific XSL separate)
* GRDDL: part of the semantec web project
* simile.mit.edu/welkin
* The functional programming aspect of XSL is the big deal - productivity wise - don't write the code as though procedural.
* Screenbook maker
* IE crashed on the presenter (oops)
* Uses Xalan, XSLT, XPath
* LEO - Literate Editor w/ Outline (written in Python) - seems like it would be cool for CSS editing also - good code block folding capabilities
* MyTimes.com
* Custom widgets - looks like an alternative to Java Portlets
* Speed advantages compared to quirks mode in the browser
* Michael Kay
