Over at [Stevey's Blog Rants](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com) is a cool article: [Code's Worst Enemy](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.html).  Stevey describes being up against getting a 500,000 line web-based game working again after some time off-line.  He sees a large code base being the worst problem you can face in software and he makes some good arguments to that point.

He also comes to the conclusion that [Justin Gehtland](http://thinkrelevance.com/about) (Name dropper! --Imaginary Ed.) talked about in Ruby on Rails training that I went to last week (I'm paraphrasing both here):  The JVM is great - the Java language is the problem.  He makes an interesting choice in the end (I'll let you read the article for yourself).
