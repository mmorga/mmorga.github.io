This was one of the panels that was a real inspiration & idea starter.  The presenters talked about how their hobies and interests provoked inspiration that could be applied to projects.  My notes:

* Nicham old style & Venitian Old Style types
* Adobe Jenson
* Vendetta - a more moden take
* Inspiration is the sum of input - not the result of copying & me too
* Look into the cultural and historical type information when choosing a typeface
* How a letterpress class led to re-thinking type ideas
* Business card ideas - corner rounder, silkscreen office stamp
* Turn Off Your Computer
* Pulp Novel covers as inspiration
* Jason Santa Maria
* Comic Books/Graphic Novels
* The Art of Looking Sideways
* (aside) These designer sure present better than tech guys
* Keep a photo archive of inspirational imagery: type, colors, etc.
* Sketchbooks
* Exercise: Be a Design Vigilante
* Puzzles: crosswords - relationships between the words
* Five-Seven-Five - the daily haiku
* 48 hour film festival
* Find a Muse
* The Birthday Bash
* Make Posters, T-Shirts, Web Site, Invites, etc.
* Wedding Planning - Invitations, web sites, etc., etc.
* Secret Santa - have to make the gift
* Virtual Stan (To Do: Look for this)
