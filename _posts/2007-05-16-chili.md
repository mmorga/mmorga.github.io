Here's the chili recipe I made for our chili cook-off at work.  It's based on a recipe from [Texas on the Halfshell](http://www.amazon.com/Texas-Halfshell-Phil-Brittan/dp/0385179049/ref=sr_1_1/102-7089083-7215325?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1179361793&sr=8-1).

* 1 3/4 lb chili grind beef
* 1 lb ground venison
* 1 c. chopped onion
* 5 cloves garlic
* 1 - 12 oz bottle Corona beer
* 1 - 8 oz can Hunt's tomato sauce
* 1 c. water
* 3 tbs. dark chili powder
* 2 tbs. ground cumin
* 6 cubes beef bouillon
* 2 tsp. oregano leaves
* 2 tsp. sugar
* 2 tsp. hot hungarian paprika
* 1 tsp. cocoa
* 1 tsp. ground coriander
* small hand-full of chili petins (around 15-20 chilis)

Brown the meat in a cast iron skillet - pour off most of the fat.  Add the onion & garlic & cook until the onions are translucent.  Add everything else and simmer covered or two hours or more.
