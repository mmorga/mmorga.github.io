The Pragmatic Programmers have suggested that you get a lot out of learning a new programming language a year.  I've been doing programming for a long time, and though I've learned a number of languages over the years, but I think I'm still behind.  This year I've been learning Ruby (which I'm loving).  For next year, I'll need to learn something else - and like many, I think I'll choose Erlang.  For kicks, here is what I've touched so far:

1. Forth
1. Basic (Commodore Vic 20, C64, Pet, Osborne, AmigaBasic probably other versions I've forgotten)
1. Logo
1. Pilot
1. Comal
1. 8502 Assembly
1. COBOL
1. C
1. Pascal
1. QuickBasic
1. Lisp
1. FORTRAN
1. CA Realizer
1. Ada
1. C++
1. REALbasic
1. Visual Basic
1. PHP
1. Java
1. Python
1. Javascript
1. Ruby

Which would be a pretty good list except I started back in '83 or so.  I've definitely not done as well in recent years.  My experience with Ruby has definitely re-energized my interest in languages.
