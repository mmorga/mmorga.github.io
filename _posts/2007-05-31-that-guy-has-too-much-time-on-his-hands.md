I've grown to hate this expression because invariably it is uttered about someone who has created something rather than spend their spare time watching TV, drinking beer, goofing off on the job, staring off into space, playing video games, etc., etc., etc.

Now, not to say that any of those activities is a waste of time (except maybe watching TV), but since when is being creative considered an inappropriate waste of time in comparison?

What does this say about us that creating things is an activity better left unseen?  Why is it better to see or buy the results of this on television or off the shelf at Wal-mart?

Just wondering.  By the way, I'm working on some stuff right now that will probably elicit a few "...too much time on my hands" comments, but I don't care.
