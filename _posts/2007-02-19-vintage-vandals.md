I ran across [the wurst gallery](http://thewurstgallery.com) today on the [Finkbuilt blog](http://www.finkbuilt.com/blog/).  I got a kick out of the gallery entitled "[Vintage Vandals](http://thewurstgallery.com/vintage_vandals.html)" in which...

> each artist was asked to find a framed piece of artwork at their local thrift store and manipulate it into a piece of their own.

My favorite is [this one](http://thewurstgallery.com/artists/vintage_vandals/driscollreid/driscoll.html) - I love giant monsters.
