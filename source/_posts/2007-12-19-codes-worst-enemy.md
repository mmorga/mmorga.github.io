Over at <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com">Stevey's Blog Rants</a> is a cool article: <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.html">Code's Worst Enemy</a>.  Stevey describes being up against getting a 500,000 line web-based game working again after some time off-line.  He sees a large code base being the worst problem you can face in software and he makes some good arguments to that point.  

He also comes to the conclusion that <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/about">Justin Gehtland</a> (Name dropper! --Imaginary Ed.) talked about in Ruby on Rails training that I went to last week (I'm paraphrasing both here):  The JVM is great - the Java language is the problem.  He makes an interesting choice in the end (I'll let you read the article for yourself).
