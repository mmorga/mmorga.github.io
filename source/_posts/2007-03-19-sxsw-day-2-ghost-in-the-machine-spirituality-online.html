This was a cool panel because it had San Antonio's own Real Live Preacher.  The discussion was focused on unique issues encountered when blogging about religion online - both pro and con.  <br />
<br />
One big pro was that being online provides an outlet for those who can't find a religious community that accepts them in their local area.  A relative negative was the angry, ugly comments that some people receive.  Another mixed fact is that members of your real-life community may have issues with what you write.<br />
<br />
The panel caught a little flack from some of the audience for not including the atheistic community, but it was an interesting discussion.
