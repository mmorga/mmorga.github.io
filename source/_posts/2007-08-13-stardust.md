I saw Stardust this weekend and enjoyed it very much. It is the sort of sweet natured fairy tale that The Princess Bride was, but isn't very similar other than being in a fantasy setting.  

The movie is changed quite a bit from the book, but not in any ways that I found offensive.  The changes are either essential compression for movie purposes or are in with the spirit of the book (Robert DeNiro's Captain Shakespeare is one of the funniest things I've ever seen him do).  Stardust moves along at a nice pace.  You get a good feel for the characters and there aren't unnecessary lulls in the plotting.  

I loved many of little details in the film: the goat turned into a man, Captain Shakespeare's crew, the choir of ghostly brothers observing and commenting on the story.  

Roger Ebert was very wrong in his review.  The plot isn't overly contrived and the deus ex machina that he accuses the film of is part of the nature of a fairy tale.  Also, other reviewers who have pointed out violence in the film are being overly sensitive.  In comparison, the Princess Bride was a more violent film.

Stardust is a well-made romantic fairy tale adventure.  I recommend it for anyone who wants to enjoy a couple of hours smiling through a fun story.
