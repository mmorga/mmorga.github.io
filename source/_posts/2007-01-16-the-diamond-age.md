Courtesy of <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives2/2007/01/post_1745.php">Instapundit</a>, I read today that Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age will be made into a miniseries on the Sci-Fi channel.  Wow.

I'm of mixed feelings here.  I'm excited that it's being done, but Sci-Fi channel's work varies in quality a bit.  George Clooney is producing (I'm moderately positive about this) and Neal Stephenson himself is doing the adaptation (WOW!).  Who is going to direct?!?!

They'll have to dial down several things for TV (the long walk on the short pier - the nudity & sex in the underwater tunnels) but I'm cautiously optimistic that this could be very cool.
