Anton and I planned on stopping by the Dorkbot tent, but the line and crowd were too intimidating, so we left, checked into our hotel, then came back for later events.

</div>The <a href="http://www.frogdesign.com/">frog design</a> SXSW Opening Party was pretty cool.  <a href="http://www.malfordmilligan.com/">Malford Milligan's</a> band put on a great blues show and the Interactive crowd proved all kinds of stereotypes about computer oriented people true.  We stayed for an hour or so, then headed out a few blocks away to the final party of the night.

The <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">BuzzFeed</a> / <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/">Ze Frank</a> After Party at the <a href="http://www.molotovlounge.com/">Molotov Lounge</a> was a good time.   Open bar - we had a lot of great conversations with people who will never remember having them with us.  Also, we ran into <a href="http://www.antonolsen.com">Anton's</a> long, lost brother:  <a href="http://michaelraichelson.com/">this guy</a>
