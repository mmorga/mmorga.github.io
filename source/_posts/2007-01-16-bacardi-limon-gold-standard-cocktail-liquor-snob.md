On Liquor Snob, I found this: <a href="http://www.liquorsnob.com/archives/2007/01/bacardi_limon_gold_standard_cocktail.php">Bacardi Limon Gold Standard Cocktail</a>.

I made a couple of these last night while making dinner (minus the gold leaf) - very yummy cocktail.  

Dinner?  Mushroom Lasagna with Butter Garlic Zucchini.  Was it yummy?  Yes it was.

If anyone can brave the ice, I have about 20 lbs of lasagna in the freezer.
