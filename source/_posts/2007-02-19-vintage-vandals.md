I ran across <a href="http://thewurstgallery.com">the wurst gallery</a> today on the <a href="http://www.finkbuilt.com/blog/">Finkbuilt blog</a>.  I got a kick out of the gallery entitled "<a href="http://thewurstgallery.com/vintage_vandals.html">Vintage Vandals</a>" in which...

<blockquote>each artist was asked to find a framed piece of artwork at their local thrift store and manipulate it into a piece of their own.</blockquote>

My favorite is <a href="http://thewurstgallery.com/artists/vintage_vandals/driscollreid/driscoll.html">this one</a> - I love giant monsters.
