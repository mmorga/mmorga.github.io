I thought this was going to be about going over the success and failures of a particular web app, but instead, this was a discussion of the numbers of income, users, servers, support calls, etc. for several different sites.  Represented were:

<ul>
<li>Blinksale
<li>FeedBurner
<li>RegOnline
<li>ParticleTree
<li>Icon Buffet
</ul>

Universally, December is the worst month and January/February the best.
