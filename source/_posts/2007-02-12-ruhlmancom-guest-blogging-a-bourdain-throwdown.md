A hilarious run-down of the state of food network by Anthony Bourdain.  I love it mostly for agreeing with me on Alton, Flay, Ray, and Giada.  The last two of which will probably get me in trouble with my parents, but so be it.  <a href="http://blog.ruhlman.com/2007/02/guest_blogging_.html">Enjoy</a>.
