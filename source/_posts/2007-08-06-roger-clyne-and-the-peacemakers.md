Saturday night, Virgie and I went up to <a href="http://gruenehall.com/">Gruene Hall</a> in New Braunfels to listen to one of my all-time favorite bands, <a href="http://azpeacemakers.com/">Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers</a>.  <a href="http://themothertruckers.com/">The Mother Truckers</a> opened the show and were excellent!  Great high energy country/roots-rock/Americana music.  Their guitar player in particular was outstanding - lightning quick solos, with precision, taste, and cool licks.

The Peacemakers put on a fantastic show also.  Every time I've seen them, I'm amazed at how much energy they put into the performance, how much they appreciate their fans, and how much fun they have playing their songs.

Roger was wearing <i>that</i> hat again.  I really need to find where I can acquire one.  Someone in the crowd brought this hilarious viking inspired hat out and Roger added it on to his gigantic sombrero. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/antonolsen/1019157233/in/set-72157601238885727/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1189/1019157233_4741d2deb2.jpg?v=0" alt="Roger Clyne with a Viking Hat"></a>Photo by <a href="http://www.antonolsen.com">Anton</a>.

Anton took some cool photos that you can check out in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/antonolsen/sets/72157601238885727/">his Flickr stream</a>.

If you ever have an opportunity to see the Peacemakers - don't pass it up.  It'll be one of the best shows you've ever seen!
