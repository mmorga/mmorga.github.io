The first session we attended was the Snakes on a Plane discussion.  It was moderately interesting, but a little light on insightful commentary.  Ultimately, I agreed with one panel member - the biggest problem with SoaP was that it was released too late after the hype peaked - people lost interest in what was otherwise a perfectly entertaining little genre disaster movie.<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<ul><br />
	<li>User generated content was added to the film (dialog, situations, etc.)</li><br />
	<li>sods50.org (suspension of disbelief) - had an event based around viewing the film ala Rocky Horror</li><br />
	<li>Crowds smell marketing a mile away</li><br />
	<li>Timing was an issue in underperformance</li><br />
	<li>How to get people involved?</li><br />
	<li>Permitting Mash-ups: no lawyers cease and desist letters, no one sued</li><br />
	<li>Additional 5 days of filming for fan additions and replacement of real snakes with CGI snakes</li><br />
	<li>Similar to Blair Witch Project in building an Internet audience</li><br />
	<li>Potential for Internet success with minimal budget - Ok, Go video for example</li><br />
	<li>Movies can embrace the Mash-up and remix culture</li><br />
</ul>
