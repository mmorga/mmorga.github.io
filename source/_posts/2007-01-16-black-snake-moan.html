I caught the trailer for <a href="http://www.moanmovie.com/">Black Snake Moan</a> when I went to Austin to see Pan's Labyrinth.  It looks like a lot of fun.  Only Samuel L. Jackson could pull this role off and he looks fantastic - I love that he is willing to change his appearance in unflattering ways to suit the character.  Let's see Tom Cruise or John Travolta appear with a bald spot on screen.  

Christina Ricci is so thin, she's almost unrecognizable. I hate seeing actresses do this to themselves, but I must admit it fits the character.
