Saturday morning came awfully early after being out so late Friday night, but I managed to meet Anton on time.  <br />
<br />
The first session of the day was "Why XSLT is sexy".  I was curios about this since I had mostly written off the suitability of XSLT as a means of making good presentation of XML.  It just always seemed like there were easier ways to solve the problem.  My notes were:<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<ul><br />
	<li>First slide: Putting Lipstick on a Pig</li><br />
	<li>Joe Orr, Lindsay Simon</li><br />
	<li>XSLT running on XML DOM parser in browser</li><br />
	<li>Unlike CSS can add new elements to the page</li><br />
	<li>XSL is a functional language - not procedural</li><br />
	<li>Fast processor in most browsers (Safari lagging)</li><br />
	<li>ActiveWidgetGrid</li><br />
	<li>bandwidth saving advantages - dl the XSL once, process many XML transactions (like AJAX ezchanges)</li><br />
	<li>AJAX-S</li><br />
	<li>XML Binding Language</li><br />
	<li>Freja and Formbuilder: MVC for Javascript, XSL is a View</li><br />
	<li>Sarissa: presents same syntax for all browsers</li><br />
	<li>AspectXML</li><br />
	<li>BrowserBasedXML.com</li><br />
	<li>detects browser w/ XSL engine and transfers only the appropriate XSL file - easier to keep browser specific XSL separate)</li><br />
	<li>GRDDL: part of the semantec web project</li><br />
	<li>simile.mit.edu/welkin</li>
	<li>The functional programming aspect of XSL is the big deal - productivity wise - don't write the code as though procedural.</li>
	<li>Screenbook maker</li>
	<li>IE crashed on the presenter (oops)</li>
	<li>Uses Xalan, XSLT, XPath</li>
	<li>LEO - Literate Editor w/ Outline (written in Python) - seems like it would be cool for CSS editing also - good code block folding capabilities</li>
	<li>MyTimes.com</li>
	<li>Custom widgets - looks like an alternative to Java Portlets</li>
	<li>Speed advantages compared to quirks mode in the browser</li>
	<li>Michael Kay</li>
