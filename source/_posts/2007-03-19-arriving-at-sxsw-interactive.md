My next few posts will be collection points for my notes on the SXSW 2007 Interactive conference I went to last week.  For the most part, the panels were interesting and informative, but more than anything, SXSW was fantastic as an idea generator.

<a href="http://antonolsen.com/">Anton</a> and I carpooled up to Austin from New Braunfels most days - I stayed with my parents.  The SXSW experience for us began on Friday.

We arrived a little after noon and spent a little over an hour waiting in the registration line.  Not too bad.  After getting our badges (I loved the warnings: badges can be replaced for the cost of walk-up admission, badges are void if removed from the badge holder), we walked up to sixth street and the Iron Cactus for some lunch.  Good food.  Great margarita.  Really bad waiter.
