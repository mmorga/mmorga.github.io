Thanks to <a href="http://heather.halo5.net/?p=110">Heather</a>, I came across this career matching quiz.  Boy have I ever been in the wrong line of work.

My results with commentary in parenthesis:
<b>1.  Makeup Artist  (heh - for horror films maybe)</b>
<b>2.  Costume Designer  (also heh - ditto)</b>
3.  Set Designer (hmm)
4.  Baker  (Sure)
5.  Butcher  (Nah)
6.  Cook  (I love to cook, but don't want to make it a job)
7.  Hydrologist / Hydrogeologist (No interest)
8.  Special Effects Technician (Sure!)
9.  Carpenter (Possibly)
10.  Industrial Designer (Put more blinking lights on it!)

Select other entries:
<b>12.  Dietitian (for the See Food Diet)</b>
<b>19.  Fashion Designer (Have you seen how I dress?)</b>
<b>25.  Interior Designer (With a specialty in Steampunk interiors)</b>
<b>27.  Pet Groomer (Specialty in shaved cats)</b>
<b>38.  Food Scientist (Just like Clark Griswold)</b>
