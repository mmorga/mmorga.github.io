The Pragmatic Programmers have suggested that you get a lot out of learning a new programming language a year.  I've been doing programming for a long time, and though I've learned a number of languages over the years, but I think I'm still behind.  This year I've been learning Ruby (which I'm loving).  For next year, I'll need to learn something else - and like many, I think I'll choose Erlang.  For kicks, here is what I've touched so far:

<ol>
	<li>Forth</li>
	<li>Basic (Commodore Vic 20, C64, Pet, Osborne, AmigaBasic probably other versions I've forgotten)</li>
	<li>Logo</li>
	<li>Pilot</li>
	<li>Comal</li>
	<li>8502 Assembly</li>
	<li>COBOL</li>
	<li>C</li>
	<li>Pascal</li>
	<li>QuickBasic</li>
	<li>Lisp</li>
	<li>FORTRAN</li>
	<li>CA Realizer</li>
	<li>Ada</li>
	<li>C++</li>
	<li>REALbasic</li>
	<li>Visual Basic</li>
	<li>PHP</li>
	<li>Java</li>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Javascript</li>
	<li>Ruby</li>
</ol>

Which would be a pretty good list except I started back in '83 or so.  I've definitely not done as well in recent years.  My experience with Ruby has definitely re-energized my interest in languages.
