This panel was on using the modern design technique of grid layout to improve web site design.  This one was good, but would have benefitted from a longer session - 30 minutes was rushed.  My notes:
<ul>
<li>subtraction.com
<li>markboulton.co.uk
<li>2 dots imply a design
<li>columns turn to grid
<li>rationalism < decore + logic, reason
<li>standardization
<li>crate & barrel's web site is a good example
<li>commentisfree.guardian.co.uk
<li>yeeaahh.subtraction.com
<li>3 or 4 columns in multiples of the base column width - 12 total is ideal
