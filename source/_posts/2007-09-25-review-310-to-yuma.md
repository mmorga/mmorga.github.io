I've been meaning to post on this since prior to ACL Fest, but here at last is a brief comment or two.

3:10 to Yuma is an excellent western.  It doesn't play revisionist history with the feeling of bad men or downplay the level of violence.  The characters are excellently played - great performances from Christian Bale and Russell Crowe.  Peter Fonda is hard to recognize as the bounty hunter Byron McElroy but he plays the part well.

This was definitely one of the best westerns in many years.  The only thing to compare it to lately is <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0105695/">"Unforgiven"</a>, but I liked Yuma even better.
