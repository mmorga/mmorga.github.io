My buddy <a href="http://antonolsen.com/">Anton</a> has started a <a href="http://halloween.lr2.com/">Halloween blog</a>.  I'll be contributing a few articles beginning this weekend with an article on making a few different kinds of blood.  In the mean time, make sure to link to his blog for a <a href="http://halloween.lr2.com/2007/09/19/win-50-bucks/">chance to win $50</a>.
