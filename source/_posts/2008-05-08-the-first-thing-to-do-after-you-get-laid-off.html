<a href="http://www.expatsoftware.com/articles/2008/05/laid-off-one-thing-you-absolutely-need.html">Interesting article here</a> about leaving on a <strong>real</strong> vacation right after getting laid off.  Most of my life, I haven't been in the financial position to do this and thankfully I've only been laid off once.  

I love the idea - shows how much I need a vacation - but I wonder if I'd have the guts to do it.
