My buddy <a href="http://www.darkdesignpictures.com/blog">Travis</a> used my apartment this weekend to shoot a short for the <a href="http://salfilmfest.com/">San Antonio Local Film Festival (SAL)</a>.  

Another home in which my neighbors wonder why zombies are roaming the neighborhood or why guys are carrying a girl wrapped in a tarp down the stairs.  Oh well.
