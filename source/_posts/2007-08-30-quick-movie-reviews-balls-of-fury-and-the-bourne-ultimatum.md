I saw <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0424823/">Balls of Fury</a> last night at the <a href="http://www.drafthouse.com/westlakes">Drafthouse</a>.  It was fun - I laughed through most of it, though it lagged a bit in the 3rd quarter.  I wish they had done more with <a href="http://www.georgelopez.com/home/home.html">George Lopez</a> - he was very funny with what he had to work with.

Sunday, I saw <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0440963/">The Bourne Ultimatum</a>.  It is one of the most non-stop movies I've ever seen.  There are no slow moving moments in this film until a brief moment towards the end.  The action is well staged, there are great twists, turns, and surprises.  My only critique would be that I could have used a little less shaky-cam in the action sequences.  I think I noticed maybe two shots in the film that may have used a tripod.  Everything else, including dialog was shot hand-held.  I thought it was really effective in the dialog scenes, but less so in the action sequences where it was difficult at times to comprehend what was happening.  Overall, I really enjoyed it.
