My group's entry into the Rackspace Rack Idol competition somehow came out on top with our rousing Bluegrass rendition of "Don't Cha" by the Pussycat Dolls.<br />
<br />
Thanks to my bandmates <a href="http://thethiers.com/">Chuck</a> and <a href="http://blog.erdener.org/"Kaan</a>!  Without you none of this will happen.  Your checks are in the mail.<br />
<br />
Kudos also to everyone else who participated - y'all are why Rackspace is so much fun to work for!<br />
<br />
