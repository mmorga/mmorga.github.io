There's a little bit of a trail to follow here, but I came across the web site <a href="http://baptistsforbrown2008.wordpress.com/2007/07/30/update-some-kilt-wearing-men-might-be-heterosexual-after-all/">Baptists for Brownback</a> via a post on <a href="http://biblewithhugh.blogspot.com/2007/08/demoniacs.html">Bible Versus</a> linked to by the <a href="http://www.reallivepreacher.com/node/1392">Real Live Preacher</a>.  Oh the paths that the Internet leads you on.

This site reads like something you might find on <a href="http://www.theonion.com">the Onion</a>, but it appears to be the honest opinions of the writers [Update - many friends think this is a humor site - please let it be so!].  Regardless, it is some of the funniest stuff I've read online in a long time.  The best article is the one which gave me the title of this post.

<blockquote><a href="http://baptistsforbrown2008.wordpress.com/2007/07/30/update-some-kilt-wearing-men-might-be-heterosexual-after-all/">Update: Some kilt-wearing men might be heterosexual after all</a></blockquote>

Some of the comments on the post (and on the initial post) have really funny quotes as well such as:

<blockquote><a href="http://baptistsforbrown2008.wordpress.com/2007/07/28/the-sissification-of-seattle/#comment-3188">When you put on a kilt you are stepping out of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s laws. You might just as well wear wizard robes and read Henry (sic) Potter.</a></blockquote>

My only fear is that they'll read this post and decide that I belong on their list of <a href="http://baptistsforbrown2008.wordpress.com/sow/">"People Who are Probably Going To Hell"</a>.  I'll just have to risk it.

Another Update: 
Most importantly, I forgot to add a link here to <a href="http://sweaterproject.org/">my favorite kilt wearing buddy</a>.
