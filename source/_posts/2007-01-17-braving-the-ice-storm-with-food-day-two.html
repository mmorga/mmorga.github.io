In the interests of keeping spirits up during this <a href="http://www.woai.com/weather/alerts.aspx#WSW175TX" title="Our Little Ice Storm">trying ordeal</a>, I've been cooking (and eating) meals fit for a king.  Last nights meal:

Baked Salmon with Lemon & Caper Vinaigrette, Fresh Green Beans, and Pan Grilled Red Potatoes with Lemon-Garlic A&iuml;oli.

Was it yummy?  Yes it was.
