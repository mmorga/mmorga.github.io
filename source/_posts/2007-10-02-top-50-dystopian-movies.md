Snarkerati posted a pretty cool list of <a href="http://snarkerati.com/movie-news/the-top-50-dystopian-movies-of-all-time/">50 best films depicting a dystopia</a>.  I'd argue with some of the ranking (good grief - they included the two worst sci-fi films of all time: Starship Troopers and Total Recall), but it definitely has some good stuff on the list.
