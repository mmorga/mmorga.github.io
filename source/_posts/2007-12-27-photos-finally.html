I finally was able to process a number of sets of photos tonight.

I ordered and received a <a href="http://strobist.blogspot.com/">Strobist</a> <a href="http://www.mpex.com/page.htm?PG=Strobist%20Kits">kit from MPEX</a>.  Here is an example or two from my first experiments with the kids:

I also took a few snapshots at Christmas.  First one from an early Christmas with the kids at my parent's house:

Then over at my grandmother's house for Christmas Eve:

Christmas day, I was up at my parent's house near the Guadalupe River, so we decided to goof around with the cameras outside:

The following day, <a href="http://sweaterproject.org/">David</a>, <a href="http://edspace.com/blog/">Edward</a> and I went downtown to get a few shots of the Christmas lights on the Riverwalk.
