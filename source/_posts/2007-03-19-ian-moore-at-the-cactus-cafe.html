Friday night, we went to see Ian Moore play at the Cactus Cafe - it was a fantastic show as always!  <br />
<br />
<a href="http://screendoormusic.com/">Bukka Allen</a> opened up the show with some really nice piano driven music with great songs and soulful vocals.  He was joined by Will Sexton on guitar and Brian Standefer on cello.  Great stuff!<br />
<br />
Ian was backed by the always amazing <a href="http://kullenfuchs.com/">Kullen Fuchs</a> on (deep breath here): trumpet, B3, omnichord, marimba, accordion, vibraphone, and probably a few other things I missed.  Bukka Allen played a few songs on accordion.  On cello was the fabulous <a href="http://www.kestrin.com/">Kestrin Pantera</a> a hugely talented  woman who was in town promoting a film.

Afterwards, I got a change to ask Ian what tuning he plays Cinamon in (open D) - so I'm one step closer to butchering another Ian Moore song for my friends and family.  <br />
<br />
It was a great night to follow up a pretty darn good day.  Afterwards, I drove Anton back home and crashed out at my parent's house.
