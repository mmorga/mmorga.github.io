My favorite development language/framework for the last nine months or so has been Ruby on Rails.  At lunch today with my Dad and one of his buddies, the topic came up and I started thinking about how to get people up and running with Ruby on Rails.  Here are my thoughts:

<strong>Getting it Installed</strong>

For OS X and various Linux flavors, I recommend getting Ruby on Rails from the main <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/down">Ruby on Rails site</a>.  

Rails development on Windows is a little more of a challenge, but you can get a reasonable start (at least enough to try things out) with <a href="http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/">InstantRails</a>.  

<strong>Editors</strong>

You can edit Ruby code with any text editor.  I prefer <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> on Mac OS X, but <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/komodo_ide/index.mhtml">Komodo</a> and <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">JEdit</a> are reasonable and work on Windows and Linux.

<strong>Online Tutorials</strong>

This is a little tough at the moment, because Rails 2.1 hasn't had as many "getting started" tutorials written as the 1.2x versions of Rails had.  

There is a long tutorial at <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails-2.1/index.htm">Tutorials Point</a> which looks like a good start.

The main Rails site has a page of <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/docs">tutorials and documentation links</a>.

<strong>Screencasts</strong>

Screencasts are a fantastic way to learn Rails.  There is a huge wealth of information here.

<a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts</a> are a series of over 100 screencasts about Rails.

<a href="http://peepcode.com/">Peepcode</a> has a number of great quality screencasts for $9 each.

<strong>Books</strong>

The two books that I recommend most are:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProgramming-Ruby-Pragmatic-Programmers-Second%2Fdp%2F0974514055%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1213750192%26sr%3D1-1&tag=comahill-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=comahill-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Dave Thomas, Chad Fowler and Andy Hunt,  and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRails-Way-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Ruby%2Fdp%2F0321445619%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1213750036%26sr%3D8-1&tag=comahill-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Rails Way</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=comahill-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Obie Fernandez.

These two books are a great learning and reference combination for Ruby on Rails development.
