A good article about to power of praise (both good and bad).  The conclusion:  specific praise for hard work = good, vacuous praise = bad.  Kids can become praise junkies which results in a withdrawal from any activity that they aren't immediately good at.  

Our "self esteem" based society is building adults that fold up and quit at the first failure.
