This was one of the panels that was a real inspiration & idea starter.  The presenters talked about how their hobies and interests provoked inspiration that could be applied to projects.  My notes:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Nicham old style & Venitian Old Style types<br />
<li>Adobe Jenson<br />
<li>Vendetta - a more moden take<br />
<li>Inspiration is the sum of input - not the result of copying & me too<br />
<li>Look into the cultural and historical type information when choosing a typeface<br />
<li>How a letterpress class led to re-thinking type ideas<br />
<li>Business card ideas - corner rounder, silkscreen office stamp<br />
<li>Turn Off Your Computer<br />
<li>Pulp Novel covers as inspiration<br />
<li>Jason Santa Maria<br />
<li>Comic Books/Graphic Novels<br />
<li>The Art of Looking Sideways<br />
<li>(aside) These designer sure present better than tech guys<br />
<li>Keep a photo archive of inspirational imagery: type, colors, etc.<br />
<li>Sketchbooks<br />
<li>Exercise: Be a Design Vigilante<br />
<li>Puzzles: crosswords - relationships between the words<br />
<li>Five-Seven-Five - the daily haiku<br />
<li>48 hour film festival<br />
<li>Find a Muse<br />
<li>The Birthday Bash<br />
<li>Make Posters, T-Shirts, Web Site, Invites, etc.<br />
<li>Wedding Planning - Invitations, web sites, etc., etc.<br />
