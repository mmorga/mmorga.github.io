I finally got a chance to see a couple of Judd Apatow movies that I've been meaning to see: <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0405422/">The 40 Year Old Virgin</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0478311/">Knocked Up</a>.  I enjoyed both of them very much. Something interesting was that despite being two very vulgar (though hilariously funny!) movies that my more conservative friends and family members wouldn't like, they had really warm-hearted and very conservative values at their core.
