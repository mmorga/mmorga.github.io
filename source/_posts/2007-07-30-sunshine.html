Go see this movie.  Right now.

I think it's the best Sci-Fi movie since Blade Runner.  It does a great job with believable technology and balances that with realistic characterizations.  Definitely see it on a big screen!  I have no idea why the film distributors have been so quiet about this movie and why the release has been so small.
