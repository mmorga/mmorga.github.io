There is so much aggression, pain, hate, anger, killing and not-niceness in the world right now.  It doesn't have to be this way.

If everyone in the world could just spend a few short days under my tutelage, the world would experience a level of united purpose and cooperation never before seen ... united in effort to eliminate me.

Just a thought.
