			<p>The bottom line, it’s well worth seeing with a couple of caveats below.</p>

<strong>The Good:</strong><br>
<ul>
	<li>The most amazing visuals that I’ve seen in a movie.  The imagery is like seeing great science fiction paintings come to life.</li>
         <li>The 3d on a 4k digital projection is by far the best I’ve ever seen.  It does take a bit to get used to and there are moments that look somewhat video game-like.  
</li></ul>
<strong>The Bad:</strong><br>
<ul>
	<li>The story is pretty pedestrian and has a lot of cliches</li>
<li>Most of the characters are two dimensional</li>
	<li>I would have liked aliens that were a little more alien and a little less “thinly veiled Native Americans”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Really Bad:</strong></p>

Like the Dude said:<br>
<blockquote><dl><dt>The Dude:</dt> <dd>I don’t see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.</dd>
<dt>Walter Sobchak:</dt><dd>Well, there isn’t a literal connection, Dude.</dd><dt>The Dude:</dt><dd>Walter, face it, there isn’t any connection.</dd></dl></blockquote>

<ol><li>The Vietcong weren’t primarily armed with bows and arrows.</li>
	<li>To imply (as this film seems to) that Al Qaeda and/or the Taliban were just innocent people sitting on a resource we wanted to steal is ridiculous.</li>
         <li>To imply further that Al Qaeda or the Taliban were just declared terrorists (despite doing nothing to provoke us) to justify attacking them is outright offensive.</li>
<li>“Daisy Cutters?”  Seriously?  Afraid that the audience wouldn’t get your subtle effort at analogy?
</li></ol>

<p>The class and race politics in Avatar are almost of caricature of rich, white, liberal guilt and self-loathing.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Business (and the military**) = universally bad (hate nature, greedy, lie, cheat, steal)</li>
<li>Shamanistic and low technology people = universally good (love nature, peaceful – except, of course, when righteously killing the above)</li>
</ul>

<p>** Except for the female soldier of color.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>

<p>James Cameron spent tens of thousands of hours to build one of the most beautiful and engaging worlds yet seen in the movies.  Unfortunately, he should have spent a weekend with a real science fiction author to come up with a story deserving of that world.  </p>
